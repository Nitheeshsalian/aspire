- This app have mock api call from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is only used for GET request to show working of network request handling by app.
- Server code have not have been implemented.
- I have used redux store as single source of truth
- For getting card details we can implement api call to server.
- Home screen debit card slide implemented using [panrespinder](https://reactnative.dev/docs/panresponder) currently its sliding from top to bottom as per design it should have fixed movement, this should be fixed since i had limited time i have not worked on it.
